            hometown on Friday meant to reinvigorate tourism and generate jobs
            and livelihood for his constituents. According to Quilala, they are
            now putting the finishing touches on 220 lamp posts each looking
            like a mini lighthouse that will illuminate the town's coastal
            villages covering Barangays Pangil, Poblacion 1 and 2, Lioes, Torre,
            and Salugan. These lamp posts will be in addition to the existing
            "Curri Lights," an array of lamp posts powered by generator sets
            that line the boulevard."

            tabacalera is claimed to be the biggest in the Ilocos region, and
            the best example of this genre in Philippine architecture. Its
            rectangular floor plan is not any different from the size of a
            normal church building. This is bigger than the tabacalera in Laoag
